# Iteration 2

## What went well?
* The team communication
* fixed all the bugs

## What didn't go so well?
* We had a lot of troubles with the courses database
* Time management

## What have we learned?
* How to use fltter's database system

## What still puzzles us?
* One error we had we couldn't replicate caused by the courses database

## Thoughts on iteration 1
Iteration 1 went rather poorly. We set out to do 3 different user stories all related to courses and only managed to complete 2 of them with a mediocre outcome.

## Going foward
With iteration 2 we don't want to make the same mistakes, therefore we only added 2 extra user stories to the product backlog.
They're both related to subjects and we still have some of the user stories related to courses left to complete.
