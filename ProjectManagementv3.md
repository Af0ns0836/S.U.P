# Iteration 3

## What went well?
* The team communication and teamwork.
* High productivity of the group.

## What didn't go so well?
* The build of the APK was more complicated than expected.
* There were some problems with test development.
* We had some trouble with the design.
* Time management.

## What have we learned?
* Test development on Flutter.
* Building an APK using Android Studio.

## What still puzzles us?
* Even now, there are some doubts about test development.
* It is still unclear to us on how Flutter calculates heights.

## Thoughts on iteration 2
* The previous iteration was quite productive, giving that we mainly worked on the course cards. Compared to the third iteration, we can say the preceding one was easier, giving that we didn't need to pay attention on as many topics as we did now.
